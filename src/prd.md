## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines the data density of professional trading platforms with the usability of modern mobile applications. The adaptive layout system ensures users get the optimal experience for their device while maintaining complete feature parity. The monochromatic design system creates a professional aesthetic that builds user trust while remaining visually appealing and modern.

The centralized state management ensures the application feels like a cohesive experience rather than separate components, which is critical for betting applications where users need confidence in their selections and bet slip accuracy.
