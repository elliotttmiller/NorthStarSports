- **Panel Management**: Smooth toggle animations, resize handles, keyboard shortcuts

### Mobile Focused Experience
- **Bottom Navigation**: Four-tab navigation system
- **Overlay Panels**: Slide-in navigation and bet slip panels
- **Responsive Transitions**: Seamless desktop-to-mobile layout adaptation

### State Management
- **Persistent Storage**: User preferences, favorites, panel states using useKV
- **Real-time Synchronization**: All panels update automatically when data changes
- **Cross-device Consistency**: State maintained across sessions

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and trust
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, elegant - inspired by premium financial applications
- **Visual Metaphors**: Trading floor aesthetics for sports betting
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with rich functionality

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic (variations of slate/gray)
- **Primary Color**: Deep charcoal (oklch(0.205 0 0)) - conveys professionalism and authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and cards
- **Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.646 0.222 41.116)) for success states and highlights
- **Color Psychology**: Gray/slate conveys stability and professionalism, amber provides warmth for positive interactions
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios throughout
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (pure white) + Foreground (deep charcoal): 11.2:1 ratio
  - Card (pure white) + Card-foreground (deep charcoal): 11.2:1 ratio
  - Primary (deep charcoal) + Primary-foreground (off-white): 9.8:1 ratio
  - Secondary (light gray) + Secondary-foreground (deep charcoal): 8.7:1 ratio
  - Accent (warm amber) + Accent-foreground (white): 4.8:1 ratio
  - Muted (very light gray) + Muted-foreground (medium gray): 5.2:1 ratio

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings (semibold), body text (regular), and captions (light)
- **Font Personality**: Modern, clean, highly legible - professional without being sterile
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized line height (1.5x), comfortable character spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font sizing scale and spacing relationships
- **Which fonts**: Inter - chosen for excellent readability at all sizes and weights
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides exceptional clarity for data-dense interfaces like odds tables

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Left-to-right flow: Navigation → Content → Actions
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding and margins to create breathing room and focus
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid for main layout, Flexbox for component-level organization
- **Responsive Approach**: Adaptive layouts that transform meaningfully across breakpoints
- **Content Density**: High information density balanced with visual clarity through proper spacing

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth panel transitions communicate state changes and maintain spatial relationships
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary: panel toggling, Secondary: button interactions, Tertiary: subtle micro-interactions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Shadcn v4 components for consistency and accessibility
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind utilities for precise styling within design system constraints
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, focused, and disabled states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency and comprehensive coverage
- **Component Hierarchy**: 
  - Primary: Panel toggles, place bet buttons
  - Secondary: Navigation items, odds buttons  
  - Tertiary: Utility buttons and micro-interactions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent use of Tailwind's spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24px base units)
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Components stack vertically, increase touch targets to 44px minimum

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent props and styling patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color variables, spacing scale, typography scale, component states
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent padding, margins, and component sizing create predictable patterns
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional aesthetic aligns with high-end financial/trading applications

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved with all color combinations exceeding 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with shortcuts for power users

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Modular component architecture allows for easy feature additions
- **Testing Focus**: Responsive behavior, state persistence, cross-browser compatibility
- **Critical Questions**: How well does the layout adapt to ultra-wide and ultra-narrow viewports?

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: React Context with useKV hooks for persistence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system variables
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, professional transitions
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## Reflection
This approach creates a truly professional sports betting interface that rivals premium trading platforms in terms of design quality and user experience. The monochromatic color scheme with subtle amber accents provides a sophisticated, trustworthy appearance while the adaptive layout ensures functionality across all devices. The emphasis on persistent state and smooth animations creates a premium feel that distinguishes this application from typical sports betting interfaces.
