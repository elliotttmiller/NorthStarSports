**Danger Color**: Red (#ef4444) for losses and destructive actions

**Color Psychology**: 
- Blue foundation builds trust and reliability
- Green accents create excitement around winning opportunities  
- Warm warnings and errors feel helpful rather than harsh

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (slate-900): White text for maximum contrast
- Card (slate-800): Light gray text (slate-100)
- Primary (slate-600): White text  
- Accent (green-600): White text
- Muted (slate-700): Light gray text (slate-300)

### Typography System

**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear scale from large headings to small metadata
**Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible - prioritizing clarity over decoration
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
**Legibility Check**: Inter excels in data-heavy interfaces and small sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Left-to-right flow on desktop (navigation → content → actions), top-to-bottom on mobile
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load while maintaining information density
**Grid System**: CSS Grid for main layout, Flexbox for components
**Responsive Approach**: Desktop-first with mobile-optimized overlays and navigation

### Animations

**Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions reinforce spatial relationships and provide feedback
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Bet slip additions get micro-animations, panel transitions are smooth, loading states are subtle
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, fast, never gratuitous

**Component Usage**:
- Accordion for hierarchical navigation
- Cards for game displays and bet options
- Buttons with clear hierarchy (primary, secondary, ghost)

- Dialogs for confirmations

**Component States**: All interactive elements have hover, active, disabled, and loading states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency and clarity

- Graceful degradation for slow connections
- Clear messaging for stale odds
- Local state with conflict resolution

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Component architecture that supports additional sports, bet types, and features
**Testing Focus**: State management, responsive behavior, accessibility
**Critical Questions**: How to handle real-time data synchronization and conflict resolution

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines the comprehensive data display needs of professional trading interfaces with the accessibility and mobile-first expectations of modern consumer applications. The three-panel desktop studio provides power users with maximum information density, while the mobile experience maintains focus and clarity.

The monochromatic color scheme with strategic green accents creates a professional atmosphere while the electric green provides the excitement factor crucial for gaming applications. Inter typography ensures excellent readability across all the numerical data and varying text sizes.

Success depends on flawless state synchronization between all panels and components, creating a unified experience where every interaction feels connected to the whole.
